Many of the things you normally need to do, do not require platforms such as SAP, Groupwares, Some CRMs and ERPs . In GLPI is enough. Take a look at what can do a properly configured GLPI.\r\n\r\nImprovements in this version compared to the original version\r\n=============================================================\r\nImprovements in:\r\n- Security in htaccess\r\n- Styles in GUI and Look and feel in CSS\r\n- HTML5 transition\r\n- Some code for user UX\r\n\r\nThe True\r\n========\r\nThe GLPI is complex to parameterize . You will need patience, a team of multi-disciplinary, will need skilled people in:\r\n- Open Source\r\n- Programming languages\r\n- Project management\r\n- Information management\r\n- Knowledge management\r\n- Resource management\r\n- Network systems\r\n- High availability systems\r\n- High performance systems\r\n- Database management\r\n- Information security\r\n- Protocols\r\n- Methods\r\n- Standards\r\n\r\nAlthough you may not believe... And of course...\r\n* GNU/LINUX üêß (are you mad bro?üòú)\r\n\r\nProfile of the Team\r\n===================\r\nPeople with this knowledge or certifications will acellerate the process\r\n- A+\r\n- Network+\r\n- ITIL (foundation)\r\n- Project Management\r\n- Web programmer (PHP, Shell, Python)\r\n- Knowledge Management\r\n- Linux+\r\n- CISM - CISA\r\n- Quality Systems Expert\r\n\r\nTerms of implementation\r\n=======================\r\nThe estimated duration for projects with GLPI phases: \r\n- GLPI installation - 1 Week\r\n- Learn curve - 6-10 weeks\r\n- Audit (initial investigation) ‚Äì 4-8 weeks\r\n- Design and description of a single process ‚Äì 3-4 weeks\r\n- Automation of a single process ‚Äì 1-3 months\r\n- Working smooth in many aspects - 1 year\r\n\r\nWhere is the magic?\r\n===================\r\nOne of these features is to manage smart cities.\r\nYes. You've read it correctly. After the thick haze of commercial words are always the same tasks that can be performed with known methods and tools but in an innovative way and according to current needs.\r\nRemember: Change the dress but not the bride. Good Luck!\r\n\r\nFirst\r\n=====\r\nThe system must be configured, to be adapted and should be parameterized according to your needs to make \" Magic\"\r\n-This is not a turnkey solution-\r\nKnow the naked GLPI: http://demo.glpi-project.org/ User: admin_en Password: admin\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\nBasic documentation about GLPI\r\nhttps://forge.indepnet.net/attachments/download/1901/glpidoc-0.85-en-partial.pdf\r\n\r\nSome Features\r\n=============\r\n-  Track everything.
