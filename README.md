GLPI for Smart Cities by Juan Fernando Villa Hern√°ndez | GLPI Evangelist aKa @elitelinux 

Why GLPI?
=========
GLPI is an excellent software that has been undervalued and is little known or used. Many of the things you normally need to do, do not require platforms such as SAP, Groupwares, Some CRMs and ERPs . In GLPI is enough. Take a look at what can do a properly configured GLPI.

Improvements in this version compared to the original version
=============================================================
Improvements in:
- Security in htaccess
- Styles in GUI and Look and feel in CSS
- HTML5 transition
- Some code for user UX

The True
========
The GLPI is complex to parameterize . You will need patience, a team of multi-disciplinary, will need skilled people in:
- Open Source
- Programming languages
- Project management
- Information management
- Knowledge management
- Resource management
- Network systems
- High availability systems
- High performance systems
- Database management
- Information security
- Protocols
- Methods
- Standards

Although you may not believe... And of course...

- Automation of a single process ‚Äì 1-3 months
- Working smooth in many aspects - 1 year

Where is the magic?
===================
One of these features is to manage smart cities.
Yes. You've read it correctly. After the thick haze of commercial words are always the same tasks that can be performed with known methods and tools but in an innovative way and according to current needs.
Remember: Change the dress but not the bride. Good Luck!

First
=====
The system must be configured, to be adapted and should be parameterized according to your needs to make " Magic"
